This is a mod for The Long Dark by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description
- This mod adds some craftable furniture to the game. The list is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/stmSantana/DIY_by_Santana/wiki).<br>
- You will need a new mod item **Nail box** to craft most wooden furniture. <br>

### Update - v1.5

### Update - v1.4

### Nail box
- NailBox can be **found** in lockers, etc., 
- NailBox can be **forged** from scrap metal.
- v1.3.0: When a player **breaks down** a wooden vanilla object (tables, chairs, etc.), you can get nails from it. (Prybar is not required)
- v1.2.1: (by Add-on file) Nail box can be **crafted** from reclaim wood x5, require ToolBox. (The reclaim wood is disassembled and disappears to remove the nails.)

## Usage
Use the "Conform to surface" shortcut key when using this mod with the "Placing Anywhere Mod". It should be possible to place things in a short time.

### Crafting Bed
You need to make each part of the bed (pillow, mattresse, frame) first and then combine them in the craft menu. You can sleep in the finished bed.<br>

### Finding Items
- Currently the new item `Wrought nail` will be spawned while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, Locker.
- I have also added spawns for all items in some locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, CampOffice.


### Adding Items
For those who don't want to spend time crafting, there is an instant way to get the item.<br>
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add diychusiona`)<br>
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.<br>
