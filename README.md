# DIY_by_Santana
This is a mod for The Long Dark by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description v1.0
This mod adds some craftable furniture to the game. The list is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/stmSantana/DIY_by_Santana/wiki).<br>
You will need a new mod item `Nail` to craft most wooden furniture. This can be found in lockers, etc., and can be forged from scrap metal.

### Finding Items
Currently the new item `Wrought nail` will be spawned while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, Locker.
I have also added spawns for all items in some locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, CampOffice.


### Adding Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add `)
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
