# DIY by Santana
This is a mod for The Long Dark by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description v1.2
- This mod adds some craftable furniture to the game. The list is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/stmSantana/DIY_by_Santana/wiki).<br>
- You will need a new mod item **Nail box** to craft most wooden furniture. <br>
- Nails can be found in lockers, etc., and can be **forged from scrap metal**. <br>

### v1.2.1
- Nail box can be crafted from reclaim wood x5, require ToolBox. (by Add-on file)
- Fixed: Add *Improvised Hatchet* to furniture harvesting tool.

### Finding Items
- Currently the new item `Wrought nail` will be spawned while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, Locker.
- I have also added spawns for all items in some locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, CampOffice.


### Adding Items
For those who don't want to spend time crafting, there is an instant way to get the item.<br>
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add diychusiona`)<br>
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.<br>
